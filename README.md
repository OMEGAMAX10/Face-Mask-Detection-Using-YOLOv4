# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-YOLOv4
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, more and more people are concerned with protecting themselves using masks, thus the need of software capable of monitoring if the people are wearing masks or not. That is why I created an Python application using OpenCV(with CUDA support) based on the YOLOv4 algorithm, capable of monitoring the safety level of a space with video surveillance.

The dataset used for training this model is the one Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/alexandralorenzo/maskdetection
